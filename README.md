An alternative to Evernote specifically intended for indexing scanned paperwork/PDFs/mail in a private and trust-no-one architecture.

## Introduction

Following my [blogpost from 2012](https://uri.agassi.co/2012/09/29/going-paperless-using-evernote/) about using Evernote for indexing
your paperless office, Evernote has changed their service to lend itself less and less to my needs. That, with other shortcomings of
their solution (like a single gigantic blob to hold my private notebook, which taxed my backup system), I've decided to write my own
version using a [.Net desktop solution](https://dev.azure.com/uriagassi/Paperless).

This is a new web implementation, meant to be deployed on your local machine, or in your local intra network. It uses the same concepts,
but is cleaner, leaner, and more available to non-Microsoft-centric machines.
